# Defining Cloud Computing
Starting point for a career in Azure
Fundational Cloud Concepts 
What is cloud computing ?
=> Delivery: Help people access computing services (servers, storage, databases, etc.), over the internet ("the cloud"), on demand
=> Advantages: Do things better and faster, server instant, scale up and down, greater flexibility
=> Cost efficiency : lower operating costs, greater effiiciency, scale as business needs change

Shared responsibility Model
- Clarification of roles and responsibility: Efficiency and convenience, Data privacy, Flexibility, Defined roles

Cloud provider is rsponsible : Physical hosts, network, datacenter
Customer is always reponsible : information and data, devices, accounts and identities

Saas: Most of the responsibilities goes to the cloud vendor
Paas : Responsibilities are shared between customer and cloud vendor
Iaas : Responsibilities is mainly on customer
On-prem : Full to Customer

Private cloud : only for one company=> quite costly because every hardware is on the head of the company <= Less flexible <= Similar to On-prem.

Public cloud : No upfront investment | vendor is responsible for hardware, full control and privacy, a lot of maintenance + upfront costs, more flexibility, available to anyone

Hybrid cloud : combine with public cloud (privare connectivity VPN / Maintain control in private cloud/on-premises), more complexity, the most flexibility, connect public workloads to private conections

## Economy of Cloud Computing
CapEx (Investissement initial pour une infrastructure physique)
=> Forecasting long term needs/value (not scalable)

OpEx (Pay as you go - Pas d'investissement initial - location de services) no need to forecast for long term needs.

Cloud model: consumption based : pay based on immediate usage, low usage = low costs, can increase resources if needed

Exam tips :
1. The cloud is on-de,and delivery of compute services over the internet
Flexibility is the key advantage
2. Ongoing, foundational topic separation of responsibility between vendor and customr
